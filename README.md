# Robot Base Design with Two Wheels  

## Project Overview  
This project involves designing a robot base with two wheels, ensuring that the total weight does not exceed 13 grams. The dimensions of the robot must not exceed the following constraints:  
- **Width:** 120 mm  
- **Length:** 100 mm  
- **Height:** 40 mm  

## Tools Used  
- **Onshape** for 3D modeling and assembly    

## Design Features  
- Lightweight structure to meet the weight constraint  
- Compact and efficient design to stay within the specified dimensions  
- Secure wheel attachment for stability
